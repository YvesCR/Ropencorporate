\description{
Fingerprint function to clean the character
}
\details{
The process that generates the key from a string value is the following:

\itemize{
\item remove leading and trailing whitespace
\item change all characters to their lowercase representation
\item remove all punctuation and control characters
\item split the string into whitespace-separated tokens
\item sort the tokens and remove duplicates
\item join the tokens back together
\item normalize extended western characters to their ASCII representation
}
}
\note{
If the entry is a numeric, it will be converted to a string character

 The returned object is a list of two data.table if the data.table package is attached. Otherwise, it is a list of two data.frame.
 Here, using the data.table package speed up the script.
